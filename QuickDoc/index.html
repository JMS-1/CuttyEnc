		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>The software you can download <A href="http://www.psimarron.net/downloads/DVB/CuttyEnc.zip">
				here</A> makes it possible to use the free MPEG2Enc utility to re-encode 
			the cut points in Cuttermaran. Cuttermaran itself is freeware but for 
			re-encoding on a B-Frame cut it will use <A href="http://www.tmpgenc.net/" target="_blank">
				TMPGEnc</A> which is a commercial application. Since starting with version 
			1.58 Cuttermaran&nbsp;will allow to use other encoders as well <A href="http://www.jochen.jochen-manns.de">
				I</A> wrote a connector to MPEG2Enc.
		</P>
		<P>
			You can use&nbsp;CuttyEnc for free but on your own risk.&nbsp;The source code 
			can be found <A href="http://www.psimarron.net/downloads/DVB/CuttyEnc_Source.zip">here</A>. 
			The official documentation is on the&nbsp;<A href="http://www.highpaqnet.de/CuttyEnc/" target="_blank">HighPaq.Net</A>. 
			Since you are using Cuttermaran I would suggest to take a look at the great <A href="http://www.highpaqnet.de/DVDGuide/HTML/index.html" target="_blank">
				DVD Guide</A> on this site.</P>
		<P>If Cuttermaran 1.63 is up and running the following additional installations 
			have to be done to get the connector running:&nbsp;</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				There should be some directory with version 0.6.9 of the <A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=59028" target="_blank">
					DVD Author</A>
			binaries which include the command line tool MPEG2Enc&nbsp;and additional DLLs 
			which are used by CuttyEnc
			<LI>
				The same tool version is included (or recommended, depending on the 
				download)&nbsp;with the <A href="http://www.boraxsoft.de/GUI_DVDauthor_01.shtml" target="_blank">
					DVD Author GUI </A>
			0.75 - these are the files I use
			<LI>
				Copy the files from the download above into the <EM>Provider/encode</EM> directory 
				of Cuttermaran</LI></UL>
		<P>The next time Cuttermaran is started the new encoder can be selected using the <EM>Actions/Settings...</EM>
			dialog.</P>
		<P>
			<img src="Selection.jpg" width="432" height="376">
		</P>
		<P>After the encoder has been selected <STRONG>it must be configured once before it can 
				be</STRONG> used by pressing the <EM>Configure...</EM> button (the dialog 
			might be in german depending on the language selected in Cuttermaran).</P>
		<img src="Settings.jpg" width="456" height="128">
		<P>The directory path to the MPEG2Enc und DLLs is selected by double clicking the 
			text field. The additional option should be left in&nbsp;the original state.</P>
		<P>If the directory path is not set MPEG2Enc <STRONG>must</STRONG> either be in the <EM>
				encode</EM> directory itself or in a directory <EM>External Tools</EM> below 
			the Cuttermaran main directory or CuttyEnc will fail. The error message 
			generated will not be very helpful if you're not a .NET developer&nbsp;- sorry 
			for that.</P>

			<P>Experimental fixes to support cutting HDTV material as described in the <A href="http://technik.movie2digital.de/thread.php?threadid=22593">

		<P><STRONG>Changes in Version 1.1.0.0 (2004/11/12)</STRONG></P>
		<BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<P>The first version of CuttyEnc used the free JPEG2YUV tool included with the 
				DVDAuthor and the GUI for DVDAuthor. The version included has a bug which leads 
				to a change in the colors. In fact there is a newer version of the tool which 
				(with a new command line option -R) corrects this behaviour. This version is 
				not available as a windows binary&nbsp;download yet and most 
				important:&nbsp;after taking a deeper look in the problem I found that JPEG2YUV 
				is not really needed!</P>
			Cuttermaran offers the movie sequence to re-encode as an AVI file to the 
			encoding provider. The codec used is YV12. The originial CuttyEnc took this, 
			decoded it to BMP (RGB), packed it to JPEG and let JPEG2YUV generate a so 
			called YUV4MPEG2 stream which is the only input format accepted by MPEG2Enc. 
			Not only the colors are changed but&nbsp;there is quite a bit of quality loss 
			due to the conversions and packings involved.</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
			<P>Starting with 1.1.0.0 CuttyEnc no longer needes JPEG2YUV. In fact the expected 
				YUV4MPEG2 stream uses a IYUV codec with only some additional string headers in 
				between. IYUV is&nbsp;semantically identically to YV12 with only the color 
				planes physically swapped. So CuttyEnc takes the YV12 input, swapps the color 
				plans, adds the headers and sends the result to MPEG2Enc. MPEG2Enc will get the 
				exact output from Cuttermaran with no color modifications and full quality. No 
				processing time gets lost due to conversions and no temporary file space is 
				needed in addition to the AVI file from Cuttermaran itself.</P>
			<P>The result is now nearly the same as for TMPGEnc. In very large magnifications 
				some tiny artefacts on color borders are visible which TMPGEnc will not 
				produce. Personally I don't think that this is worth the difference in price. 
				In addition the 'DVD compliant stream' option in Cuttermarn now generates a 
				smooth result and even in an animation scene I could see no difference from the 
				original movie - using 8000kbps encoding and no magnifier.</P>
